Made by me: *D. H. Lelis* for the discipline *SCC0215 (File Organization)* on the *first semester of 2022*.

## Overview

This was a semester-long project for the discipline of "File Organization". The
project was built using C (project requirement) and consisted of 3 main deliveries.

## Build & Run

There are no aditional dependencies, to run the project you can either use CMake,
or the Makefile inside the `src` directory. `make all` builds the project, `make run`
executes the built binary and `make clean` delete the existing build artifacts. There
are also multiple "environments" that controls how errors are handled, mostly, you can
control it by passing the `env=test` or `env=debug` argument to GNU Make.
